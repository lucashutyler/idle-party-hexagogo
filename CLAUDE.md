## Project Overview

Idle Party RPG — a multiplayer idle RPG on a hexagonal world map. Characters fight, move, and progress 24/7 whether the player is connected or not. Built as a monorepo with a web client, game server, and game manager.

## Branch Policy

**`main` is a locked branch.** All changes must go through pull requests — never commit directly to `main`.

## Game Design Philosophy

- **One character per player** — all mechanics incentivize this
- **Weak solo, strong together** — every class benefits greatly from partying with any other class
- **Henchmen** — hireable NPCs for players without friends online yet
- **Always running** — game state persists and progresses whether connected or not
- **Always in a party** — every player is always in a party, even if solo. A solo party is auto-created on login/restore. Leaving a multi-player party auto-creates a new solo party. Players can always position themselves on the 3x3 grid.
- **Always in combat** — the party is never truly idle; combat triggers continuously on every tile (towns, forests, etc.). Combat is shared per-party — all members fight the same monsters together. Combat is tick-based (1s per tick): each alive player attacks a target monster, then each alive monster attacks a target player, using grid-based targeting (same row first, front-line preference, scan up before down). Battles end when all monsters are dead (victory) or all players reach 0 HP (defeat). The result/movement cadence remains unchanged.
- **Server authoritative** — combat resolved server-side, updates pushed to clients
- **Database-driven content** — tiles, monsters, quests stored in DB, managed via game manager
- **Instanced worlds** — soft-capped at 1000 players; invites allowed beyond cap, no random joins
- **Web-first** — mobile-friendly is the primary use case, desktop fully supported

## Monorepo Structure

npm workspaces monorepo. `npm run dev` runs server + client concurrently.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start server (:3001) + client (:3000) concurrently
npm run dev:client   # Client only
npm run dev:server   # Server only
npm run build        # Build shared → client → server
npm start            # Production: NODE_ENV=production, serves client + WS from one port
npm run test         # Run all tests (vitest)
npm run test:shared  # Shared package tests only
npm run typecheck    # tsc --build (all packages)
```

**Worktree setup**: Git worktrees do not share `node_modules` with the main repo. When working in a worktree, run `npm install` before building. The shared package must be built before client/server can typecheck (project references resolve via `dist/` output, not source).

## Architecture & Patterns

- **Hex coordinates**: Cube coordinates (q, r, s) where q + r + s = 0, flat-top hexagons, HEX_SIZE = 40px
- **Multi-screen app shell**: DOM-based screen switching (not Phaser scenes). `ScreenManager` handles show/hide with `onActivate`/`onDeactivate` lifecycle. Combat is the default screen; Map lazy-loads Phaser on first visit.
- **Email-based magic link auth**: Auth is handled over REST (`/auth/*`), not WebSocket. Flow: enter email → receive magic link (dev: auto-verify) → choose username → game. Sessions use `express-session` with httpOnly cookies (30-day expiry), persisted to disk via `JsonSessionStore` (survives server restarts/deploys). In dev (`NODE_ENV !== 'production'`), verification is instant. In production, a magic link is emailed via AWS SES. Account data (email, username, verified status) is stored in `data/accounts.json` via `AccountStore`. Magic link tokens are in-memory with 15-minute expiry (`TokenStore`). Username is changeable later.
- **WebSocket auth via session cookie**: WebSocket upgrade requests are authenticated by parsing the session cookie server-side. If no valid session/username, the upgrade is rejected with 401. No login messages are sent over WS — identity comes from the cookie.
- **Per-player game state**: Each player has a `PlayerSession` with character state, unlocks, combat log, and social data. Combat and movement are managed per-party by `PartyBattleManager`, which owns a shared `ServerParty` + `ServerBattleTimer` for each party. `PlayerSession` delegates battle/position queries to `PartyBattleManager` via callbacks wired by `PlayerManager`. Sessions persist when disconnected (battles keep running). `PlayerManager` maps usernames to sessions and WebSockets to usernames. Multiple connections per username are supported.
- **GameClient subscriber pattern**: `subscribe(cb)` / `onConnection(cb)` return unsubscribe functions. Multiple screens listen concurrently. `lastState` cache lets late-mounting screens read current state immediately. Connection is deferred until `connect()` is called (after auth).
- **Phaser isolation**: Phaser only runs when the Map tab is active. `game.loop.sleep()`/`wake()` halts/restarts the entire RAF loop. On re-activation, state is snapped (not tweened) so the player sees "where I am now" with no catch-up animation.
- **Browser tab resume**: On `visibilitychange` → visible, the client sends `request_state` for an immediate server response (no waiting for the next battle cycle). The party position snaps instantly; the camera pans smoothly (500ms).
- **Event-driven**: Systems use callback properties (`onTileReached`, `onBattleEnd`, `onTilesUnlocked`) — scene subscribes for state sync
- **State machines**: `ServerBattleTimer` (`battle` | `result`), `ServerParty` (`idle` | `moving` | `in_battle`). Each party's battle loop runs continuously and never stops: `battle` → `result` (1s celebration/move window) → `battle` → … Movement happens instantly at the start of the result window; the client animates the tween during the celebration pause. Battle duration is determined by tick-based HP combat (1s per tick).
- **Character & leveling**: Each player has a `CharacterState` (class, level, XP, stats, priority stat). XP is earned on victory (`XP_PER_VICTORY = 10`). XP to next level = `100 * currentLevel`. On level-up, 2 stat points are allocated (to priority stat if set, random otherwise). Max HP = `30 + (level-1)*5 + CON`.
- **Combat engine**: Pure functions in `CombatEngine.ts`. Solo: `createCombatState()`/`processTick()` — player attacks first alive monster (STR ± 2, min 1), then all alive monsters attack player. Party: `createPartyCombatState()`/`processPartyTick()` — all alive players attack targets, then all alive monsters attack targets. `findTarget()` implements grid-based targeting on the 3x3 grid (positions 0-8): row = floor(pos/3), col = pos%3. Same row first; players prefer low-column monsters (front), monsters prefer high-column players (front); if no same-row target, scan up (lower row) then down (higher row). Equipment bonuses (`bonusAttackMin/Max`, `damageReductionMin/Max`) apply per-combatant.
- **Zone system**: Each `HexTile` has a `zone` string property. `ZoneTypes.ts` defines `ZoneDefinition` with encounter tables (weighted monster selection). Current zones: `friendly_forest` (Lv1 goblins) and `darkwood` (goblins, wolves, bandits). `createEncounter(zoneId)` uses the zone's encounter table for weighted random monster/count selection. Zone display name is sent to the client in `ServerStateMessage.zoneName`.
- **Monster system**: `MonsterTypes.ts` defines `MonsterDefinition` catalog (goblin, wolf, bandit) with `drops?: ItemDrop[]` per monster, and `createEncounter(zoneId?)` factory with zone-aware weighted encounters. Each `MonsterInstance` has a `gridPosition: PartyGridPosition` for combat grid placement.
- **Item & equipment system**: `ItemTypes.ts` defines items, rarities (`janky` 40%, `common` 25%), and equipment slots (`head`, `chest`, `hand`, `foot`). Items stack up to 99 in inventory. Equipment modifies combat: `bonusAttackMin/Max` adds to player damage, `damageReductionMin/Max` reduces incoming monster damage. Pure functions handle inventory/equipment operations (`addItemToInventory`, `equipItem`, `unequipItem`, `computeEquipmentBonuses`, `rollDrops`). Drops are rolled per-monster on victory. The `ItemsScreen` shows equipment slots (tap to unequip) and inventory (tap equippable items to equip). Current items: Janky Helmet (head, 0-1 reduction), Rusty Dagger (hand, 1-3 attack), Leather Vest (chest, 1-2 reduction), Mangy Pelt (non-equippable material).
- **Procedural map generation**: `MapData.ts` uses a seeded PRNG (mulberry32, seed=42) for deterministic world generation. The schema tiles form the "Friendly Forest" starting zone (~170 tiles). A border ring of mountains/water surrounds it with 4 exit gaps (3 tiles wide each). Beyond the border, ~1300 "Darkwood" wilderness tiles fill a ~45x45 offset-coordinate area (-15 to 28). Both server and client generate identical maps from the same seed — no map data is transmitted over the network.
- **Server-side combat log**: `PlayerSession` maintains the last 100 log entries (battle start/end, damage, level-ups, movement, tile unlocks) with a running `battleCount`. Both are included in every `ServerStateMessage`. The client `CombatScreen` is a pure renderer of the server-provided log — no client-side state-transition tracking.
- **Other players on map**: Each state message includes `otherPlayers: { username, col, row, zone }[]`. WorldMapScene renders same-zone players as individual markers; other-zone players show as count badges on their tile. Positions update on each player's own battle cycle.
- **Room info modal**: Clicking a tile on the map opens a modal showing room name, type, players present, and a "Go to room" button. `TileInfoModal` class handles the DOM overlay. (UI calls tiles "rooms"; code still uses "tile" internally.)
- **Zoom controls**: Mobile-friendly +/- zoom buttons on the map screen, wired to `WorldMapScene.adjustZoom()`.
- **Floating HP bars**: CombatScreen renders HP bars floating above each combat sprite (players and enemies) arranged in grid formation rows (3 rows based on `gridPosition`). Player labels show username (current player highlighted in gold); monster labels show name only. HP shown as percentage bar only. Dead combatants are dimmed.
- **Desktop font scaling**: `@media (min-width: 768px)` media query increases font sizes for all UI elements on desktop.
- **Social system**: Full social tab (6th tab) with 5 sub-tabs:
  - **Users**: All registered players (not just online) with search, sort (name/status), filter (all/room/zone/friends/guild/party). Online/offline status dots with group headers when sorted by status. Friend request (Add/Revoke/Accept/Decline based on request state), block/unblock, chat actions per user. Data sourced from `AccountStore.getAllUsernames()`.
  - **Friends**: Request-based two-way friend system. Sections: Incoming requests (Accept/Decline), Online friends, Offline friends, Pending sent (Revoke). Outgoing requests persisted per-player; incoming index rebuilt on player init. Cross-requests auto-accept. Unfriending is symmetric (removes from both players).
  - **Guild**: Create guild (level 20+, 2-20 char name), join, leave, invite members. Guild data persisted in `data/guilds.json`. Leader auto-transfers on leave.
  - **Party**: Every player is always in a party (solo party auto-created, max 5 members). Three-tier role hierarchy: owner > leader > member. Party creator is owner. Owner can promote/demote leaders, transfer ownership, and kick anyone. Leaders can kick (including other leaders, but not owner) and move the party. Members cannot invite, kick, or move. Pending invite flow: owner/leader invites → target sees pending invite with accept/decline → same-room validated on both invite and accept. Badge indicator on Party tab when invites pending. 3x3 grid positioning for combat formation. Combat is shared — all members fight the same monsters together with grid-based targeting. Movement is party-level (owner/leader moves all members). On victory, each member gets XP/gold/loot independently. Leaving/kicked auto-creates new solo party at current position. If owner leaves, first leader becomes owner; if no leaders, first member becomes owner.
  - **Chat**: WoW-style unified timeline with all channels in one scrollable view, color-coded by channel type. 6 channel types: Room (tile), Zone, Party, Guild, Global, DM. Toggle filter pills to show/hide each channel. Channel selector dropdown for sending (Party/Guild disabled when unavailable). DM autocomplete with validation — message input disabled until valid recipient entered. Chat "buttons" throughout social screens and room modal open DM with that user. Per-user chat history (1000 msgs, saved with player data) — messages persist with the player forever, not with the channel. Blocking (`dm` or `all` levels) filters messages server-side.
- **Social badges**: Badge dot (red) on Social bottom-nav tab when there are pending friend requests, party invites, or unread chat. Sub-tab badges (`*`) on Friends (incoming requests), Party (pending invites), and Chat (unread messages) tabs.
- **Social state**: `ClientSocialState` is included in every `ServerStateMessage.social`. Contains friends, incoming/outgoing friend requests, guild info, guild members, party info, pending party invites, outgoing party invites (sent by this player), online players list, all registered players list, blocked users, and chat preferences (send channel + DM target). `PlayerManager` builds this via `getSocialState()` callback on each `PlayerSession`.
- **Separation of concerns**: Phaser Graphics for rendering, HTML/CSS for all non-map UI (camera-independent), pure logic in shared systems
- **A* pathfinding**: Hex distance heuristic with cross-track tie-breaker
- **Visual style**: Pixel/retro RPG — Press Start 2P font, CSS custom properties for theming, CSS keyframe animations for battle states. All UI is vanilla HTML/CSS (no framework).
- **State persistence**: Player state is periodically saved (every 30s) and on graceful shutdown via `GameStateStore` interface. Current implementation uses JSON files on disk (`JsonFileStore`). On restore, battle timers start fresh (no retroactive simulation); a "Server back online" log entry is added. On shutdown, a "Server shutting down" log entry is added. Saved state per player: `username`, `battleCount`, `combatLog` (last 1000 entries), `unlockedKeys`, `position`, `target`, `movementQueue`, `character` (className, level, xp, stats, priorityStat, inventory, equipment), `friends`, `outgoingFriendRequests`, `blockedUsers`, `guildId`, `partyId`, `partyRole`, `partyGridPosition`, `chatHistory` (last 1000 messages), `chatSendChannel`, `chatDmTarget`. The `character` field is optional in `PlayerSaveData` — old saves get a fresh Level 1 Adventurer on load. The `inventory` and `equipment` fields are optional within `character` — old saves default to empty inventory and all-null equipment. Social fields are optional — old saves default to empty. Party state (`partyId`, `partyRole`, `partyGridPosition`) is saved and restored — multi-player parties survive server restarts. Guild data is saved separately in `data/guilds.json`. The store interface is swappable for SQLite/Postgres.
- **Client UI state persistence**: Active screen and social sub-tab are saved to `sessionStorage` so browser refreshes restore the user's last view. Chat channel preference (send channel + DM target) is persisted server-side so it syncs across devices. Incoming chat messages are appended to the DOM without re-rendering the entire chat panel, preserving input focus and typed text.

## Keeping Docs Current

When making changes that affect architecture, patterns, file structure, or game design decisions, **always update this file (CLAUDE.md) and README.md** to reflect the new state. This is especially important for:
- New screens, systems, or major features
- Changes to the file tree or monorepo structure
- New game design decisions or philosophy changes
- Architecture pattern changes (e.g., new subscription models, state management)
- README.md roadmap checkboxes — check items off as they are completed

## State Persistence Maintenance

**When adding or changing any per-player game state** (new systems, new fields on `PlayerSession`, `ServerParty`, etc.), you **must** update the save/restore logic to include the new state:
1. Update `PlayerSaveData` in `GameStateStore.ts` with the new field(s)
2. Update `PlayerSession.toSaveData()` to serialize the new state
3. Update `PlayerSession.fromSaveData()` to restore the new state
4. If the state lives in a sub-system (like `UnlockSystem`), ensure that system supports restoration from saved data

## Data Folder Convention

Everything in `data/` is persisted behind a **swappable interface** so the storage backend can be changed from JSON files to a database without modifying consumers:
- **Game state**: `GameStateStore` interface (`server/src/game/GameStateStore.ts`) → currently `JsonFileStore`
- **Sessions**: express-session `Store` class → currently `JsonSessionStore` (`server/src/auth/JsonSessionStore.ts`)
- **Accounts**: `AccountStore` reads/writes `data/accounts.json` directly (should be interfaced when migrating to a DB)
- **Guilds**: `GuildStore` reads/writes `data/guilds.json`
- **Chat**: Stored per-player in `PlayerSaveData.chatHistory` (saved with each player's JSON file)

When adding new persistent data to `data/`, always define an interface or extend an existing one. Never read/write files directly from game logic — go through the store abstraction.

## Code Conventions

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Semicolons**: Always
- **Naming**: PascalCase classes, camelCase methods/properties, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE constants
- **Strict TS**: No implicit any, no unused locals/parameters, no fallthrough in switch
- **Imports**: Client/server import shared via `@idle-party-rpg/shared`; within-package imports use relative paths
- **Class layout**: Properties → constructor → public methods → private methods
- **Error handling**: Defensive checks with early returns
- **README checklists**: The README.md roadmap uses `[x]`/`[ ]` checklists — check items off as they are completed
- **Tests**: Aim for test coverage on all non-rendering logic (systems, utils, pathfinding, server)
- **UI terminology**: In all user-facing text (UI labels, error messages, combat log), refer to hex tiles as **"rooms"**. Code internals (variable names, class names, comments) may still use "tile" — the rename is UI-only.
